# zeeds (**Z**ero d**E**pendency s**EEDS**)

*Too small for their own repository. Too useful to not exist.*

Zero-dependency Java 25+ source files designed as starting points for your projects. Run directly with `java filename.java` — no compilation step needed. Each zeed is self-contained, using only JDK APIs. Copy, customize, extend.
